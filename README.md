# SkArclight

SkArclight is a Skript addon to be used on [**Arclight**](https://github.com/IzzelAliz/Arclight)/[**Mohist**](https://mohistmc.com) servers.     

# Features:
- Dynamically adds ItemTypes for all modded items.    
2 instances will be added, 1 just as the key of the item, 1 without special characters.    
  - Format:
    - `mod_name:mod_item`
    - `mod name mod item`
    - `mod_name:category/sub_item`
    - `mod name category sub item`    
  - Examples:
    - `tfc:candle_cake/lime`
    - `tfc candle cake lime`
> [!WARNING]    
> Skript will still send errors for missing ItemTypes.     
> This happens before SkArclight loads and can be ignored.
- ItemTypes also allow for custom BlockData to work as well.
- Adds a few syntaxes to get/spawn custom entities.
- MORE TO COME!
